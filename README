synk
====

Synchronize a bunch of files between different hosts.

* one-shot tool (no running daemon)
* Compares sha512 to check synchronisation status
* Last modification time used to elect a "master"
* uses `rsync(1)` for fast copying between peers

The following requirements are needed in order for `synk(1)` to work
between multiple peers:

* `synk` must be installed, and in the `$PATH` on each peer
* peers must be able to interconnect via `ssh` (without a prompt)

usage
-----

	$ cat /etc/synk.conf
	peer keel.z3bra.org
	peer phobos.z3bra.org

	$ synk -v $HOME/file
	peer: localhost /home/z3bra/file        c8e37eb 1473157623
	peer: phobos.z3bra.org  /home/z3bra/file        6d4af03 1473157643
	peer: keel.z3bra.org    /home/z3bra/file        005f686 1473157705
	master: keel.z3bra.org
	synk: rsync -azEq --delete keel.z3bra.org:/home/z3bra/file /home/z3bra/file
	synk: ssh keel.z3bra.org rsync -azEq --delete /home/z3bra/file phobos.z3bra.org:/home/z3bra/file

	$ synk -v $HOME/file
	peer: localhost /home/z3bra/file        005f686 1473157705
	peer: phobos.z3bra.org  /home/z3bra/file        005f686 1473157705
	peer: keel.z3bra.org    /home/z3bra/file        005f686 1473157705

syntax
------

The configuration file (default: /etc/synk.conf) contain the peers
definition, one per line, in the following format:

	peer <host> [port]

If no port is specified, the default value (9723) will be used. Hosts
can be specified either by their fqdn, or ip address.

how it works
------------

Local client spawns server-mode instances to peers via ssh:

	synk $FILE
	 \_ ssh phobos.z3bra.org 'synk -s'
	 \_ ssh apophis.z3bra.org 'synk -s'
	 \_ ssh doom.z3bra.org 'synk -s'

Client sends metadata for `$FILE` to each peer, which includes the following:

	* filename (as passed on the command line)
	* sha512 digest for this file
	* last modification fime

Each peer will then recreate this structure locally, using the given path
and send it back to the client, which will build a list of peer/metadata
internally.

This list is then processed to figure out wether all sha512 digests
together match or not. In case a difference is found, the modification
times are used to determine a "master", which will `rsync` it local file
to all other peers (localhost included).

In this case, we have two possibilities:

### localhost is the most recent

If localhost is the most recent, we just spawn `rsync(1)` processes
locally to update the file with peer that have a different hash:

	synk file
	 \_ rsync -azEq file phobos.z3bra.org:file
	 \_ rsync -azEq file apophis.z3bra.org:file
	 \_ rsync -azEq file doom.z3bra.org:file

### remote peer X is the most recent

We need to spawn `rsync(1)` processes remotely on the host, to sync it
with all the peers (except for localhost):

	synk file
	 \_ rsync -azEq phobos.z3bra.org:file file
	 \_ ssh phobos.z3bra.org 'rsync -azEq file apophis.z3bra.org:file'
	 \_ ssh phobos.z3bra.org 'rsync -azEq file doom.z3bra.org:file'
